## Profile
I am an honest, positive, and enthusiastic individual who is fully able and determined in continuing a career as a Web Developer. 

With my proven problem solving skills and ability to easily translate complex concepts into simplistic equivalencies, I am confident in what I can accomplish.

I'm an eager learner, very hard working, and committed towards achieving professional goals. I possess ambition and reliability, with strong analytical and rapport building skills.

## Skills

#### Problem Solver with Initiative

When Developing Code, I have had to undergo a lot of research and error handling. I thoroughly Google all of my issues and if that doesn't work I go to a forum or chat room and ask for help there.

As a Data Analyst I took it upon myself to learn about macros and how to implement them into, originally, very time consuming reports.

Weekly lab sessions, during my Physics Degree, consisted of experimentation, result taking, data analysis, and interpretation. Attention to the minutest of details was of great importance.

Retail Customer Service has experienced me in finding quick solutions to technical related problems, for, quite often agitated, customers. These moments took advantage of my ability to keep calm, in order to think clearly and efficiently solve problems.

#### Confident Communicator

At University, I had to collate a lot of scientific and legal information, and explain some very complex concepts. I was able to refine essential communication skills, through producing reports and presenting them to experts and novices, in a very clear and concise manner.

Regular staff meetings, throughout my Retail work, were useful for discussing ways in which we could increase our efficiency. This gave me crucial experience in getting my point across to others who were not always open to new ideas.

Throughout my Call Centre work, I have called members of the public and asked them to take part in research surveys, and whether they would like to donate to selected charities. My success in these roles relied on my ability to communicate clearly, professionally, and respectfully.

#### Committed

I received Hull Compact Award for both of my years at Wyke College. This is awarded for achieving 95% or above attendance.

Upon completing study at Sydney Smith Secondary School, I had successfully fulfilled my duties as a School Prefect. I was awarded this role for my ability to de-escalate intense situations, and for my above-average attendance.

At Guru Nanak Gurdwara, Hull, I assisted with Punjabi classes which I originally attended as a child. These are set up to teach young children how to read and write in Punjabi.

My working experiences have shown a clear reflection of my dedication, with sick leave only ever being taken in extreme circumstances.

#### Team Player

I attended several weekend-camps, as an Army Cadet, where my barracks would compete against other barracks, in various different activities. These experiences gave me a lot of discipline and taught me the importance of working well within a team.

During my time at Capstone Communications, lesser-qualified engineers often looked to me for guidance. I gained valuable experience in keeping team moral high, whilst demonstrating the benefits of working in a time-efficient manner.

In Retail and Marketing, I had to convince staff to help me, in selling and promoting a client's product, over any competitor products. I exercised my knowledge and passion, and showed my genuine will to reciprocate, in order to successfully form dedicated allies who were always eager to help.
